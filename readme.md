# Reason Envelope Modifier

This is a project dedicated to a DAW called [Reason](https://reasonstudios.com), which contains these 2 nifty devices that has user defined envelopes.
The devices are called [Europa Shapeshifting Synthesizer](https://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/instruments/europa), and Grain Sample Manipulator
I wanted to take advantage of this, and make sharp sounding waveforms, but because of how small the box is for editing 
the envelopes

# IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE, READ THIS PLEASE
For those who want to contribute to the project, and you do not have a copy of Reason, you can use the online Europa player
Located here [https://www.reasonstudios.com/europa-player](https://www.reasonstudios.com/europa-player)
The device is the same as if you were actually using it in Reason

Download an init patch (Basically the whole device is reset)
Remember, the file extension needs to be .repatch
